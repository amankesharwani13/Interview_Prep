⭐ What is Forecasting? (Simple Word)

Forecasting means predicting future values based on past data.

Example:
Predicting next month's sales based on past sales.

⭐ Types of Forecasting Algorithms (Explained Super Simple)
1. Moving Average (MA)

👉 Looks at the average of the last few values and uses it to predict the next one.
👉 Works well when data is stable (no big ups & downs).

Example:

Sales for last 3 months:
10, 12, 14

3-Month Moving Average =
(10 + 12 + 14) / 3 = 12

So forecast for next month = 12

2. Exponential Smoothing

👉 Gives more importance to recent data than older data.
👉 Useful when recent values matter more.

Formula uses a smoothing factor α (0–1).
more alpha -> more weight on current observation.
less alpha -> more weight on previous observation.

Example:

Previous forecast = 100
Actual last value = 120
α = 0.5

New Forecast =
0.5 × 120 + 0.5 × 100 = 110

3. Holt’s Linear Trend Model(Double exponential smoothing)

👉 Useful when data has a trend (increasing or decreasing).
👉 Adds 2 things:

Level (current value)

Trend (direction)

Example:

Sales increasing like:
100, 120, 140…

Holt’s model learns the upward trend and predicts higher values.

4. Holt–Winters (Triple Exponential Smoothing)

👉 Used when data has:

Trend

Seasonality (pattern repeats every year/month/week)

Example:

Ice cream sales:
High in summer, low in winter.

Holt-Winters captures this repeating pattern to forecast correctly.

5. ARIMA (Most Popular Forecasting Model)

👉 Best for time-series with patterns.
👉 Uses:

Past values (AR)

Past errors (MA)

Differencing (I) to remove trend

Example:

If sales data is like:

100 → 120 → 150 → 180 → 210 → (clear trend)

ARIMA can predict future values like 240, 270…

6. SARIMA

👉 ARIMA + Seasonality
Use this when data repeats periodically.

Example:

Electricity usage
Higher in summer → lower in winter → repeats every year

SARIMA handles this pattern better than ARIMA.

7. Prophet (by Facebook/Meta)
Prophet is an open-source time series forecasting library created by Meta (formerly Facebook) for Python and R that is used to predict trends in time-series data

👉 Easy-to-use ML model for forecasting
👉 Handles:

Trend

Seasonality

Holidays

Missing values

Example:

Facebook uses it to predict user activity or ad revenue.

Forecasting with Prophet is just:

model = Prophet()
model.fit(df)
future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=30)
forecast = model.predict(future)

8. LSTM (Deep Learning Model)

👉 A neural network for sequence prediction
👉 Best when data has long-term patterns
👉 Works well for:

Stock prices

Weather

Energy demand

Example:

It can learn very complex patterns like:

"Stock goes up after 3 red days and 2 green days"

9. What is a Time Series?

A set of data points collected over time (daily, monthly, yearly).

Example:
Daily temperature, monthly sales.

10. What is Univariate Forecasting?

Forecasting using only one variable (e.g., only past sales).

11. What is Multivariate Forecasting?

Forecasting using multiple variables (e.g., sales + ads + weather).

12. Why do we do Differencing?

To make time series stationary (remove trend).

13. What is Forecast Horizon?

How far into the future you want to predict.

Example:
Next 7 days → horizon = 7

14. What metrics do you use to evaluate forecasting?

MAE
MSE
RMSE
MAPE

15. What is Autocorrelation?

When previous values influence future values.

16. Why use Prophet?

Because it:
is very easy
handles trend + seasonality + holidays
works well on business data
handles missing values automatically

17. What are the components of Prophet?

Trend
Seasonality
Holidays
Error

18. Can Prophet handle missing values?
Yes, automatically.

19.What is LSTM?
LSTM is a neural network that can remember long-term information and is used to process sequential data.

20. What is Backtesting in forecasting?
Testing the model by predicting past values and comparing them with actuals.

21. What is Overfitting in forecasting?
Model learns noise instead of pattern.
