🎯 1. What is Python?

Python is a programming language used for web apps, ML, data science, automation, and more.

🎯 2. What are variables?

A variable stores a value.

Example:

x = 10
name = "Aman"

🎯 3. What is a list?

A list stores multiple values.

Example:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]

🎯 4. What is a tuple?

Tuple is like a list but cannot be changed.

Example:

colors = ("red", "blue", "green")

🎯 5. What is a dictionary?

Stores data in key-value pairs.

Example:

student = {"name": "Aman", "age": 21}

🎯 6. Difference between list and tuple?
List	Tuple
Changeable	Not changeable
[]	()
🎯 7. What is a function?

A block of code that performs a task.

Example:

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

🎯 **8. What is *args and kwargs?

Used to pass many arguments.

Example:

def show(*args):
    print(args)

show(1,2,3)

🎯 9. What is OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming → uses classes and objects.

🎯 10. What is a class?

Blueprint for creating objects.

Example:

class Car:
    pass

🎯 11. What is an object?

Object = instance of a class.

Example:

c = Car()

🎯 12. What is inheritance?

One class taking features of another.

Example:

class A:
    pass

class B(A):
    pass

🎯 13. What is polymorphism?

Same function name, different behavior.

Example:

print(len("hello"))
print(len([1,2,3]))

🎯 14. What is encapsulation?

Hiding data using private variables.

Example:

class A:
    __x = 10

🎯 15. What is abstraction?

Hiding complex code from the user.

🎯 16. What is a constructor?

Special function that runs automatically.

Example:

class A:
    def __init__(self):
        print("hello")

🎯 17. What is lambda function?

Small one-line function.

Example:

add = lambda x,y: x+y

🎯 18. What is list comprehension?

Short way to create lists.

Example:

nums = [x*2 for x in range(5)]

🎯 19. What is an exception?

Error in program.

🎯 20. How to handle exceptions?

Using try–except.

Example:

try:
    print(10/0)
except:
    print("Error")

🎯 21. What are modules?

Python file you can import.

Example:

import math

🎯 22. What are packages?

Folder containing multiple modules.

🎯 23. What is pip?

Python package installer.

🎯 24. What is virtual environment?

Separate Python environment for each project.

🎯 25. What is self?

Refers to the current object inside a class.

🎯 26. Difference between == and is?
==	is
checks value	checks memory

Example:

a = [1,2]
b = [1,2]
print(a==b) # True
print(a is b) # False

🎯 27. What is mutability?

If a value can be changed.

List → mutable

Tuple → immutable

🎯 28. What is a decorator?

Function that modifies another function.

Example:
def deco(func):
    def wrap():
        print("hello")
        func()
    return wrap

@deco
def say():
    print("world")

say()


🎯 29. What is a generator?

Function that returns values one by one using yield.

Example:

def gen():
    yield 1
    yield 2

🎯 30. What is yield?

Used in generators to pause and return a value.

🎯 31. What is recursion?

A function calling itself.

Example:

def fact(n):
    return 1 if n==0 else n*fact(n-1)

🎯 32. What is the GIL?

Global Interpreter Lock → allows Python to run one thread at a time.

🎯 33. Difference between thread and process?

Thread = lightweight, inside one process
Process = independent program

🎯 34. What is multithreading?

Running multiple threads at same time.

🎯 35. What is multiprocessing?

Running programs on multiple CPU cores.

🎯 36. What is a decorator used for?

Logging, authentication, caching.

🎯 37. What is map, filter, reduce?

map → apply function to each item
filter → keep only items that pass condition
reduce → combine items into one result

Example:

list(map(lambda x:x*2, [1,2,3]))

🎯 38. What is a shallow copy vs deep copy?

Shallow copy → copies only reference
Deep copy → copies all nested objects

Example:

import copy
copy.copy()
copy.deepcopy()

🎯 39. How memory management works in Python?

Python uses garbage collector to delete unused objects.

🎯 40. What is __str__ and __repr__?

Used to print object nicely.

🎯 41. What are magic methods?

Double underscore methods like __init__, __add__.

🎯 42. What is a context manager? (with)

Manages resources.

Example:

with open("file.txt") as f:
    data = f.read()

🎯 43. What is enumerate()?

Gives index + value.

Example:

for i, v in enumerate(["a","b"]):
    print(i, v)

🎯 44. What is zip()?

Combines lists.

Example:

for a, b in zip([1,2],[3,4]):
    print(a, b)

🎯 45. What are Python data types?

int, float, str, bool, list, tuple, dict, set
