✅ TOP MCP (Model Context Protocol) Interview Questions — Simple Answers
1️⃣ What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard way to connect AI models with tools, databases, APIs, or external systems.

In simple word:
👉 MCP is a bridge that allows LLMs to talk to external tools safely.

2️⃣ Why do we need MCP?

Without MCP, every company builds their own custom tool calling method.
MCP gives a standard rule so any model → can use any tool.

3️⃣ Who created MCP?

OpenAI created MCP, and now many companies support it.

4️⃣ How does MCP work?

MCP uses:

Servers → Tools

Clients → LLM chat systems

Messages → JSON format communication

LLM → Client → Server → Tool → Result → Back to LLM

5️⃣ What is an MCP Server?

It is a backend program that exposes tools, like:

Database query tool

Weather API

Local file reader

Email sender

Think of it as:
👉 “A toolbox the LLM can use.”

6️⃣ What is an MCP Client?

The system where the LLM runs (like ChatGPT, LangChain, LangGraph).
It requests the tool from the MCP Server.

7️⃣ What is a Tool in MCP?

A function the LLM can call.

Example:

get_weather(city)
read_file(path)
generate_id()

8️⃣ What is the benefit of MCP compared to normal tool calling?
Normal Tool Calling	MCP
Each framework different	One standard protocol
Hard to maintain	Easy to reuse tools
Model-specific	Model-independent
Security unclear	Built-in permissions
9️⃣ Is MCP model-agnostic?

YES.
Any LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, etc.) can use MCP.

1️⃣0️⃣ Does MCP run locally?

Yes. MCP servers can run on:

Local machine

Docker

Cloud servers

1️⃣1️⃣ What is a “Resource” in MCP?

A resource is data exposed to the LLM safely.

Example resources:

customer_data.csv

embeddings.db

config.json

Think:
👉 “Read-only or controlled access data.”

1️⃣2️⃣ What is a “Prompt Template” in MCP?

You can expose templates for LLM, like:

summarize_template: "Summarize the following text: {text}"

1️⃣3️⃣ How does MCP improve security?

It uses:

Permission prompts

Sandboxing

Explicit access control

Scope-limited tools

LLM cannot access system files without permission.

1️⃣4️⃣ What is the message format of MCP?

MCP uses JSON-RPC 2.0 style messages.

Clean, structured, and easy for tools to parse.

1️⃣5️⃣ What’s the difference between MCP and APIs?

API is general-purpose.
MCP is specifically built for LLM tool usage.

LLMs can provide structured input → MCP translates to exact function call.

1️⃣6️⃣ What is the purpose of list_tools?

It lists all tools exposed by the server.

Example:

["read_file", "write_file", "search_db"]

1️⃣7️⃣ What is call_tool?

The actual execution request from LLM to the MCP server.

1️⃣8️⃣ What is the role of permissions in MCP?

Before tool execution, the system may ask the user:

"Allow the model to access file xyz.txt?"

This improves safety.

1️⃣9️⃣ How is MCP used in LangGraph?

LangGraph supports MCP servers to give agents access to:

Files

RAG vector databases

Web APIs

Custom Python functions

This makes your agent more powerful and safe.

2️⃣0️⃣ What is an example use-case of MCP?

✔ Chatbot reading local files
✔ AI agent querying database
✔ LLM filling Excel files
✔ Code assistant modifying project files
✔ CRM integration
✔ Email automation

2️⃣1️⃣ Can MCP connect multiple tools?

Yes.
You can have one MCP server exposing:

Weather API

SQL database

File system

Custom functions

LLM uses whichever it needs.

2️⃣2️⃣ What languages support MCP servers?

Currently:

Python

Node.js

Rust

Go

And more coming.

2️⃣3️⃣ What is the communication protocol used?

WebSockets or STDIO.

2️⃣4️⃣ Is MCP open source?

Yes. MCP is fully open and free.

2️⃣5️⃣ Why is MCP the future of tool calling?

Because it:

Standardizes everything

Makes AI agents universal

Improves safety

Reduces developer work

Works with any LLM
