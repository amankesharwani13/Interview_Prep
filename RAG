✅ TOP RAG INTERVIEW QUESTIONS — Explained in Simple Words
1️⃣ What is RAG?

RAG = Retrieval-Augmented Generation
It means:

👉 LLM + External Knowledge

The model retrieves relevant documents and then generates better answers.

2️⃣ Why do we use RAG?

Because LLMs don't know everything.
RAG helps in:

✔ reducing hallucination
✔ using private data
✔ improving accuracy

3️⃣ What are the main steps in RAG?

Embedding text → into numbers

Store embeddings → in vector DB

Search relevant chunks

LLM generates final answer using retrieved data

4️⃣ What is Vector Database?

A database that stores embeddings and allows similarity search.

Examples: FAISS, Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate.

Simple:
👉 “Google search inside your own data.”

5️⃣ What are embeddings?

Embeddings are numerical vectors representing meaning of text.

Example:
“Apple” (fruit) and “banana” → close in embedding space.

6️⃣ What is chunking?

Breaking big documents into small pieces.

Why?
LLM cannot take 200-page PDF in one go.

7️⃣ What is vector search?

Searching similar meaning instead of exact words.

Example:
Query: “How to recharge battery?”
Match: “Steps to charge your device.”

8️⃣ What are the components of a RAG system?

Document loader

Text splitter

Embedding model

Vector database

Retriever

LLM

9️⃣ What is a retriever?

It selects the most relevant chunks from the vector DB.

Example:
Top-3 similar chunks.

1️⃣0️⃣ Difference between RAG and fine-tuning?
RAG	Fine-tuning
Adds external knowledge	Changes the model
Cheap	Expensive
No training needed	Training needed
Flexible	Less flexible
1️⃣1️⃣ When should you use RAG?

Use RAG when you need:

✔ private data
✔ updated information
✔ fast changes
✔ cost-efficient solution

1️⃣2️⃣ When NOT to use RAG?

❌ Data is extremely structured
❌ User queries require heavy reasoning
❌ Data changes every second

1️⃣3️⃣ What is Hybrid Search?

Combination of:

semantic search

keyword search

Helps when user needs exact keywords.

1️⃣4️⃣ What is metadata filtering?

Filtering search results based on tags.

Example:
Only show documents of 2024 or HR department.

1️⃣5️⃣ What is re-ranking?

After retrieving top chunks, a model re-orders them to pick the best ones.

1️⃣6️⃣ What is context window?

The maximum amount of text an LLM can take as input.

RAG helps by reducing irrelevant text.

1️⃣7️⃣ What is hallucination in LLM?

When LLM makes up fake answers.
RAG reduces this by giving real documents.

1️⃣8️⃣ What is Retrieval Pipeline?

All steps from query → retrieval → LLM answer.

1️⃣9️⃣ What is multi-vector RAG?

Using multiple embeddings per chunk:

Title

Paragraph

Keywords

Entities

Better retrieval accuracy.

2️⃣0️⃣ What is multi-modal RAG?

RAG using:

text

images

PDFs

audio

tables

Example: Searching inside scanned PDFs.

2️⃣1️⃣ What is query expansion?

Automatically expanding user query.

Query: "loan eligibility"
Expanded: "loan rules", "home loan eligibility", "bank document requirements"

2️⃣2️⃣ What is chunk overlap?

Small overlapping text so context isn’t lost.

2️⃣3️⃣ What is BM25 (traditional search)?

A keyword-based retrieval algorithm.
Useful for exact match queries.

2️⃣4️⃣ RAG vs. Search Engine?

Search engine → retrieves only

RAG → retrieves + LLM generates answer

2️⃣5️⃣ What is negative sampling in RAG training?

Selecting irrelevant documents to improve retriever training.

26️⃣ What are the challenges in RAG?

Bad chunking

Wrong embeddings

Irrelevant retrieval

Too much or too little context

Slow search in huge DB

27️⃣ How to evaluate RAG?

Metrics:

Retrieval precision

Relevance score

Answer correctness

Context overlap

28️⃣ What is LLM-as-a-Judge?

Using an LLM to check if retrieved documents are accurate.

29️⃣ How to optimize RAG?

Better chunking

Re-ranking

Hybrid search

Metadata filters

Smaller & faster embeddings

30️⃣ What is end-to-end RAG evaluation?

Evaluate:

Retrieval quality

Answer quality

Ground truth matching

🎯 BONUS: 30-second interview reply

You can say:

“RAG is a method where an LLM retrieves relevant information from a vector database and uses it to generate an accurate answer. It reduces hallucinations and allows models to use private or updated data. A RAG pipeline includes chunking, embedding, storing in a vector DB, retrieving, and LLM generation.”
