✅ How I Deploy an Assignment Using Docker, Rancher Desktop, WSL & Azure

1️⃣ Develop the Project (Local Machine)
I first complete my Python/Flask/FastAPI/Node project on my local machine.

2️⃣ Install Required Tools
I install:
WSL → Linux environment inside Windows
Rancher Desktop → provides the Docker engine (nerdctl)
Docker CLI / Nerdctl → to build and run containers
Azure CLI → to deploy my container

3️⃣ Write a Dockerfile
I create a Dockerfile inside the project folder.
Example:
FROM python:3.10-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

This tells Docker:
which Python image to use
install requirements
run the app

4️⃣ Build Docker Image (WSL Terminal)
Inside WSL terminal:
nerdctl build -t myapp:latest .

This creates a docker image.

5️⃣ Run the Docker Container Locally
To check if it works:
nerdctl run -p 5000:5000 myapp:latest

Now I open browser and check:
👉 http://localhost:5000
This confirms the image works.

6️⃣ Push the Image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)
Step 6.1 – Login
az login
Step 6.2 – Login to ACR
az acr login --name <my-acr-name>
Step 6.3 – Tag the Image
ACR images need a special tag:
nerdctl tag myapp:latest <my-acr-name>.azurecr.io/myapp:latest
Step 6.4 – Push the Image
nerdctl push <my-acr-name>.azurecr.io/myapp:latest

Now the image is stored on Azure.

7️⃣ Create Azure Container App Environment
az containerapp env create \
  --name my-env \
  --resource-group my-rg \
  --location centralindia

8️⃣ Deploy the Application on Azure Container Apps
az containerapp create \
  --name myapp \
  --resource-group my-rg \
  --environment my-env \
  --image <my-acr-name>.azurecr.io/myapp:latest \
  --ingress external \
  --target-port 5000


Azure assigns a public URL.
This URL is the live deployment.

9️⃣ Verify Deployment

I open Azure Portal → go to Container Apps → copy the URL and test it.


You can speak like this:

“I develop the project locally, then I use WSL and Rancher Desktop to build a Docker image.
I create a Dockerfile, build the image using nerdctl, and run it locally to test.
After that, I tag the image and push it to Azure Container Registry.
Then I create a Container App Environment in Azure and deploy the container from ACR.
Azure gives me a public URL where my application runs.”



✅ TOP Docker Interview Questions (Simple Answers)
1️⃣ What is Docker?

Simple:
Docker is a tool that packages your application and all its dependencies into one small box called a container, so it runs the same everywhere.

2️⃣ What is a Container?

A small lightweight environment where your app runs.
It contains only what your app needs → fast & portable.

3️⃣ What is an Image?

A template or blueprint used to create containers.
Like a photo → container is a photocopy.

4️⃣ What is a Dockerfile?

A text file that tells Docker how to build an image.

Example: install Python, copy files, run app.

5️⃣ What are Docker Volumes?

A way to store data outside of containers, so data is safe even if the container is deleted.

6️⃣ What is Docker Compose?

A tool that helps you run multiple containers together (e.g., app + database) using one YAML file.

7️⃣ What is the difference: Image vs Container?

Image → blueprint

Container → running instance of that image

8️⃣ What is Docker Hub?

Online store for Docker images (public or private).

9️⃣ How do you build a Docker image?
docker build -t myapp .

🔟 How do you run a Docker container?
docker run -p 5000:5000 myapp

1️⃣1️⃣ What is the purpose of EXPOSE in Dockerfile?

Tells which port the container uses.

1️⃣2️⃣ What is ENTRYPOINT vs CMD?

ENTRYPOINT → main command

CMD → default arguments
Easy rule: ENTRYPOINT is fixed, CMD can change.

1️⃣3️⃣ What is the difference: Docker vs Virtual Machine?

Docker uses containers → lightweight, fast

VM runs full OS → heavy, slow

1️⃣4️⃣ What is Layering in Docker?

Each instruction in Dockerfile creates a layer.
These layers are cached → builds are faster.

1️⃣5️⃣ What is Docker Registry?

A storage where images are saved (Docker Hub, Azure ACR).

1️⃣6️⃣ What is ACR (Azure Container Registry)?

Azure’s private Docker image store.

1️⃣7️⃣ How do you push an image to Docker Hub or ACR?
docker push repo/image:tag

1️⃣8️⃣ How do you check running containers?
docker ps

1️⃣9️⃣ How do you stop a container?
docker stop <id>

2️⃣0️⃣ What happens when a container stops?

The application inside stops running.
But image and data (volumes) remain.

2️⃣1️⃣ What happens when you delete a container?

Only that running copy gets deleted.
Image stays.

2️⃣2️⃣ What is the context in Docker build?

The folder contents sent to Docker engine for building.

2️⃣3️⃣ What is .dockerignore?

File that tells Docker “ignore these files when building.”

Example:
.env, __pycache__, node_modules

2️⃣4️⃣ What is multi-stage build?

Use multiple FROM in Dockerfile to reduce final image size.

2️⃣5️⃣ What is Port Mapping?

Connecting container port to host port.

Example:
-p 5000:5000

2️⃣6️⃣ How do you see logs of a container?
docker logs <container_id>

2️⃣7️⃣ What is the use of WORKDIR in Dockerfile?

Sets the default working directory inside the container.

2️⃣8️⃣ What is a base image?

The starting image used in Dockerfile (e.g., python:3.10-slim).

2️⃣9️⃣ What is tagging of an image?

Giving version/name to an image.

Example:
myapp:v1

3️⃣0️⃣ What is the difference: ADD vs COPY?

COPY → simple file copy

ADD → can download URLs or extract tar files
Use COPY mostly (best practice).

3️⃣1️⃣ How do you remove all containers?
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)

3️⃣2️⃣ How do you remove images?
docker rmi <image>

3️⃣3️⃣ What is Docker Network?

Containers can communicate with each other inside a virtual network.

3️⃣4️⃣ What is Bridge Network?

Default network; containers can talk to each other.

3️⃣5️⃣ What is Host Network?

Container uses the host machine’s network directly.

3️⃣6️⃣ What is bind mount?

Mounting a folder from your machine into container.

3️⃣7️⃣ How do you inspect a running container?
docker inspect <id>

3️⃣8️⃣ How do you exec into a container?
docker exec -it <id> bash

3️⃣9️⃣ Difference between Container Restart Policies?

no → don’t restart

always → restart always

on-failure → restart only if crash

4️⃣0️⃣ What is OCI?

Open Container Initiative – standards for containers & images.

4️⃣1️⃣ What is Rancher Desktop?

A tool that gives Docker/nerdctl engine on Windows (alternative to Docker Desktop).

4️⃣2️⃣ What is nerdctl?

Docker-compatible CLI provided by Rancher Desktop.

4️⃣3️⃣ How do you deploy Docker containers to Azure?

Steps:

Build Image

Push to ACR

Deploy using Azure Container Apps / Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

4️⃣4️⃣ What is Image ID and Container ID?

Unique identifiers for image or container.

4️⃣5️⃣ Why do we use slim images?

They are lightweight → faster & more secure.

4️⃣6️⃣ What is ENV in Dockerfile?

Sets environment variables.

4️⃣7️⃣ What is HEALTHCHECK?

Tells Docker how to check if the app inside container is healthy.

4️⃣8️⃣ What is BuildKit?

Modern backend for faster and parallel Docker builds.

4️⃣9️⃣ What is the lifecycle of a container?

Image → Create → Start → Run → Stop → Remove.

5️⃣0️⃣ What kind of projects have you Dockerized?

Always mention:

Flask API

Node API

React + Backend

ML model API
