Hi, my name is Aman Kesharwani. I’m from Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh. I completed my B.Tech from USICT, Delhi. I joined Nagarro around five months ago as an Associate Engineer. 
During this time, I completed my training in Generative AI—covering LangChain, LLMs, LangGraph, MCP, FastAPI, prompt engineering, agents, multi-agent systems, and multimodal models. 
I also worked on deploying LLM applications on Azure using Docker and Azure Container Registry. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with NLP, deep learning, machine 
learning, Flask, and Streamlit.
