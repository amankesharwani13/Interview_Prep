1. What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is when a computer learns from data and makes predictions without being explicitly programmed.

⭐ 2. Types of Machine Learning?
1) Supervised Learning

Model learns using labeled data (input + correct output).
Examples:

Spam detection

Price prediction

2) Unsupervised Learning

Model learns patterns from unlabeled data.
Examples:

Clustering customers

Grouping similar items

3) Reinforcement Learning

Model learns by trial and error with rewards.
Examples:

Game-playing AI

Self-driving cars

⭐ 3. What is Overfitting?

Model learns too much, including noise, and performs well on training data but bad on new data.

Simple example:
Memorizing answers instead of understanding them.

⭐ 4. What is Underfitting?

Model is too simple and cannot learn patterns.

⭐ 5. How to avoid Overfitting?

More data

Regularization (L1, L2)

Dropout (for deep learning)

Early stopping

Cross-validation

⭐ 6. What is Bias and Variance?

Bias: Error from wrong assumptions (underfitting).

Variance: Error from too much sensitivity (overfitting).

Goal: Balance both → Bias-Variance Tradeoff.

⭐ 7. What is Feature Engineering? (Simple)

Improving raw data into useful features so the model learns better.

Examples:

Extracting date → day/month/year

Combining columns

Encoding text or categories

⭐ 8. What is EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)?

Understanding and exploring data using:

Visualization

Statistics

Outlier detection

Missing values check

⭐ 9. What is Normalization and Standardization?

Normalization: Scale data between 0 and 1

Standardization: Scale data to mean 0 and std 1

Used for distance-based models like KNN.

⭐ 10. Difference: Classification vs Regression

Classification: Predict category
Example: spam or not spam

⭐ 18. What is K-Means?

A clustering algorithm that groups data into K clusters.

⭐ 19. What is PCA (Principal Component Analysis)?

Reduces number of features while keeping important information.

⭐ 20. What is Gradient Descent?

Algorithm used to minimize loss (error).
Model adjusts weights step-by-step.

⭐ 21. What is Learning Rate?

How big each step is in gradient descent.

⭐ 22. What is Loss Function?

Measures how wrong the model is.
Examples:

MSE (regression)

⭐ 23. Evaluation Metrics
For classification:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

For regression:

MAE

MSE

RMSE

R² Score

⭐ 24. What is Precision and Recall (Simple)?

Precision: Out of predicted positives, how many were correct.

Recall: Out of actual positives, how many we predicted correctly.

⭐ 25. What is F1 Score?

Harmonic mean of Precision & Recall.
Used when data is imbalanced.

⭐ 26. How do you handle missing values?

Drop rows

Fill with mean/median/mode

Model-based imputation

⭐ 27. What is Encoding (One-Hot, Label Encoding)?

Converting category text into numbers so model can understand.

⭐ 28. What is Regularization?

Technique to reduce overfitting by adding penalty.

L1 (Lasso)

L2 (Ridge)

⭐ 29. What is Cross Validation?

Split data into many folds and test each fold.
More reliable than single train-test split.

⭐ 30. What does Train-Test Split do?

Helps measure model performance on unseen data.

⭐ 31. What is Confusion Matrix?

A table that shows:
TP, FP, FN, TN
Used to evaluate classification.

⭐ 32. What is Outlier?

A data point that is very different from others.
Example: salary 10, 20, 25… and 5,00,000.

⭐ 33. What is Correlation?

Relationship between variables.

⭐ 34. What is Feature Selection?

Choosing only important features.

⭐ 35. What is Hyperparameter Tuning?

Finding best settings for model such as:

K in KNN

Max depth in tree

Learning rate

⭐ 36. What is Embedding in ML?

Converting text or items into meaningful numbers (vectors).
Used in NLP, RAG, search.

⭐ 37. Difference between Machine Learning and Deep Learning?

ML: Simple models like KNN, trees, SVM

DL: Neural networks with many layers

⭐ 38. What is a Neural Network?

Nodes connected like the human brain; learns patterns.

⭐ 39. What is an Epoch?

One full loop of training over entire dataset.

⭐ 40. What is Batch Size?

Number of samples processed at once.

⭐ 41. What is Activation Function?

Gives non-linearity.
Examples: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh.

⭐ 42. What is Self-Attention? (Simple)

Model looks at important words in a sentence.

⭐ 43. What is Transformer? (Simple)

A model architecture that uses self-attention.
